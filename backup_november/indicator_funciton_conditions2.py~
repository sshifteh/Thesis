	A loop should go over the wss at the bdry,
	depending on whether its above or below a threshold value it added to subracted from it respectively.
	The result is that the indicator function shows a geometry that is to be added or subracted from the old 
	geometry. 

	
	So the ind_f is empty to begin with really.
	However, the WSS_bdry function is full. For each value in the WSS_bdry function
	we will evaluate it if it is above the tresh_H or below the tresh_L we all a value to the 
	ind_f array, else we just add zero
