	"""

	The implicit function, K, creates separates the R**2. The zerocontour gives and interface.
	The outer region is assigned value 1, while the inner is assigned value 0.
	This can be expressed as a function of one variable by the Heaviside function
	By definition the directional derivative of the Heaviside function is the dirac delta function.
	The volume or surface integral of a funcion over a domain is defined as the product of the function and the drac delta function.
	The dirac delta function picks out the boundary.
	
	Something similar I am trying to do here.
